# About
This repository contains all my workspace templates, configurations, list of extensions and other tools I use on my projects. There are different branches to this repository. Each of them corresponds to differen workspaces. For example; The branch C++_Workspace, contains all the necessary information and stuff about my C++ projects and codes.

I use this repository to keep track of my configuration files and project structure templates across different machines. 

Current branches and their purposes:
```
|- main -> Contains system-wide config files such as rc files and automated bash scripts
|- C_Workspace -> Basic C99 project template. I use this branch as a reference when writing C codes.
|- C++_Workspace -> Basic C++20 project template. It has the same purpose as C_Workspace but for C++ projects.
|- Python_Workspace -> Consists of a README.md file and some .vscode settings for my Python working environment.

```
