# About
Collection of multiple tools, configs and scripts I use for my daily work. \
This repository is mainly for my own use, but feel free to use it as you wish. \
There are multiple branches for different purposes, see below for more information.

## Directory Structure

```

## Scripts
Many shell commands require a lot of typing, so I created some scripts to make my life easier.
These scripts are located under the `Scripts` directory. \
\
Here is a list of all the functions.
```bash
lz_ip() # Print network interfaces and their IPv4 addresses.
```
